# Final Assignment - Portfolio

##Brief Explanation 

In this file, I will explain how I created my portfolio website; the challanges I had; how I overcame or couldn't overcame them.

In my portfolio website there are basic four pages; home, services, about and contact.

I chose to show my portfolio samples on my home page. Some of the web pages I coded are included, as well as vector art and images from earlier projects.

On the services page, there are the things that I have learned and offer to do. About page is where I introduce myself; tell about my strong sides. Contact page includes my email and adress information as well as a contact form where employers can reach me.
