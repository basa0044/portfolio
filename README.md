# Final Assignment - Portfolio

## Brief Descriotion

In this file, I will explain how I created my portfolio website; the challanges I had; how I overcame or couldn't overcame them.

In my portfolio website there are basic four pages; home, services, about and contact.

I chose to show my portfolio samples on my home page. Some of the web pages I coded are included, as well as vector art and images from earlier projects.

On the services page, there are the things that I have learned and offer to do. About page is where I introduce myself; tell about my strong sides. Contact page includes my email and adress information as well as a contact form where employers can reach me.


## Challanges & Overcomes

1. I had a very hard time overlaying my div box with text on my banner image at the front page. 

I wanted to try and find a way to achieve this look without using position elements. However, I had trouble making my design responsive. In the end, I used position elements and searched how to center my div box on my banner image. There are still some problems in mobile size in terms of responsiveness. That is something I need to work on.

2. I had the same issue on my contact page, where I wanted to center my form on top of the image.

3.
